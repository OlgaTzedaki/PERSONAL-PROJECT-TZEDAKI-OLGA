    <em>Please note that this post is not promoted by Netflix nor by any platforms of this nature.</em> <br></br>
    The Covid- 19 pandemic, the widespread recession, have all contributed to the resurgence of various Y2K trends and, to be more exact, TV shows. In the light of the above, it is natural for people to want to turn to happier, carefree times to find comfort. 
    <br></br>
    If you belong to gen Z, the generation currently dominating the realm of trendsetting, you are probably familiar with the tendency of romanticizing, glorifying, and worshipping, in a sense, everything 2010. As fascinating as it is to me, at least, to think of all the mind-boggling trends that are going to arise once generation Alpha (if you’re like me, you’re going to find this article truly interesting) becomes the one with the most collective power in terms of influencing and driving the trends, I reckon that the vibes this part of pop culture give off are low-key, high-key <em>it</em>. 
<br></br>

As a proud mid – to - late zoomer, I feel proud to have embraced the sweet melancholia accompanying 2010. Answering my call, I have gathered a meticulously curated collection of iconic shows that epitomize what I believe 2010 pop culture represented. 
<br></br>

Let’s dive right into it!
<br></br>
1.	 <strong>Modern Family</strong>
<br></br>
<img src="/assets/modernfamilymain.jpg" style="height: auto;" style="width:auto;"/>

<br></br>
Modern Family is a singular mockumentary. Having received 22 Emmy awards, it is fair to consider this show worthy of its extreme popularity, rave reviews and loyal fanbase. Running for 11 consequent years (September 23, 2009, to April 8, 2020), it has been characterized as “outstanding comedy” repeatedly. Having watched it multiple times myself, I can confirm that this is one hundred percent representative of the series. Plus, exquisitely multifaceted characters and tremendous acting together make for an exceptional piece of art. Throw in the amazing job done by the producers, screenwriters, and crew, and what you have is the recipe of effortless laughing fits! 
It was running on Netflix for 11 whole years but sadly was made unavailable last year. However, if you’re eager to spend some time with this crazy fam, you could purchase a Disney+, Hulu, ABC, or Amazon Prime subscription.  
<br></br>
2.	<strong>Gilmore Girls</strong>
<br></br>

<br></br>
Technically, this does not fall under the umbrella of 2010’s shows since it started airing in 2000 and its ending run in 2007. However, most of my peers watched it in the 2010’s and it remains a sweet memory to this day. 
<br></br>
No wonder why this is a fan favorite. A warm and fuzzy mother – daughter relationship surely attracts the viewers. It is beautifully and realistically depicted, making this show a worthy addition to everyone’s watchlist. 
<br></br>
Even though it’s a relatively old series, it is available on Netflix to this day. A sequel titled “Gilmore Girls: A year in life” followed and received equally enthusiastic praise. 
<br></br>
3.	<strong>Big time rush</strong>
<br></br>
<img src="/assets/btr.jpg"/>

<br></br>
Oh, to be a kid again, watching BTR every day, then going to sleep! Good times. 
<br></br>
Big Time Rush, a successful Nickelodeon production, was a TV show that also served as a way of promoting the band, which propelled to international stardom. The show had it all: just the right amount of teenage drama, loving family relationships, a genuine friendship amongst the boys, and catchy tunes. 
<br></br>
BTR run from 2009 to 2013. The band toured in 2014 and then disbanded for the bandmates to pursue their individual careers, which they did to this day! They are active on social media and remain close friends. They also presented us with a little reunion because of the pandemic in April 2020, where they got together – virtually – and performed one of their most popular songs: “Worldwide”. Considering the universality of the pandemic’s repercussions, it is evident that they chose this specific song symbolically. 
<br></br>
It is safe to say that my obsession with living in the US in the 2010’s was this show’s fault. I still want to visit the set if it exists. Whenever I get to watch an episode or two (some Greek private TV providers still run the show, but Nickelodeon hasn’t made it available for our country), I feel as if I’m transported to simpler and more carefree times. It truly is a blast from the past. Good thing it is so timeless that I still get to laugh at the jokes no matter what! 

<br>
<br>
That's all I've got for today :)
