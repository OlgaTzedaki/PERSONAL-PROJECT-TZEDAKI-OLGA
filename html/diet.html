<h1>
  <strong>How diet culture is failing us (or, a girl's struggle with body image)</strong>
</h1>

<div>
  <p>I heard something really unsettling the other day. There was this post on Instagram which read: ‚ÄúNew study reveals that girls begin wishing for their thighs to be thinner at 6 years old‚Äù. <br></br>
    At first, I didn‚Äôt know how to react. Should I feel lucky to be born a little bit before the ‚Äúexplosion‚Äù of social media, and their effect? Or, rather, should I be angry and pity those poor children? Because that‚Äôs what they are, literal children. And this is where I knew that there is a problem.
    It is a plain fact that the dieting mindset has become a part of our life. It's become so normalised that, approaching New Year's, Instagram was flooded with posts regarding a "fresh start" in 2023 or a post-holiday detox diet. 
    When exactly did we get there, as a culture? 

    The roots of the issue date back to 1863, where one man shared that a low - carbohudrate and reduced calorie diet enabled him to shed some pounds. Little did he know that what he said would be so widespread that we would discuss eating disorders in 2023. Turns out that whoever thought of the "with great power comes great responsibility" quote couldn't be closer to the truth. 

    There are a million different kinds of dieting, all looking promising and all seeming to be "the one for you". What all these diets have in common is the result: developing a restriction mindset, your body resisting in being put in starvation mode, the restriction leading to an over - abundance mindset and the dieter ends up re-gaining the weight lost, or even more. This "yo-yo" dieting not only slows down the metabolism but also takes a toll on one's mental wellbeing. 

  <br></br>
  My personal experience with dieting is not great. I am, in general, someone who has always eaten healthy; it's been part of my lifestyle. What I did differently than most people was subsituting ordinary items for the lower-cal, low-fat, whole-grain, sugar-free and palm oil - free versions. Whole - grain pasta, rice, bread, cereal and crackers, for instance, where staples for me, alongside 2% fat cheese, yoghurt, and milk. In the end, my habits formed my dietary preferences: I now cannot stand tasting full - fat milk, or pasta made of refined flour. 
  I also consumed tons of fruit and vegetables, mostly because they were of my liking. 
<br></br>
Although I used to view myself as a healthy person, I can recall incessantly trying to change my body's shape and, consequently, weight. Fortunately, I kept seeing the same number on the scale; probably because I exercised excessively. There was a time, 3 years ago, where I had basketball practice 4 or 5 times a week, 2 hours each day. At that time, I didn't think about food. And then came 8th grade. 
<br></br>
The pandemic was a relatively new phenomenom back then. I had just started going to school again as a new student, despite the fact that it was my second year in middle school. I was assimilating smoothly until the 2nd quarantine hit, which was the longest one. 
I am a person who sticks to the rules. Given the regulations set and my attitude towards them, I did not leave the house for 5 months, and, in hindsight, it was tough. I know realise that the pressure applied by the school, combined with the anxiety enforced by the pandemic combined did not serve me well. My dietary habits changed and I started to suffer from what is called "binge - eating episodes". I would eat huge amounts of food and still go back for seconds even if I were full, to the point I felt sick. When this school year came to an end and the summer holidays began, I exercised frantically and ate very little food in order to lose the weight I've put, and it worked. I thought I was healthy back then, starting 9th grade at about 54 kg. 2022 might have been a good year, but that didn't prevent what had happened the year before from happening again: in May 2022, just 9 months after the school year had started, I'd put on 4 kg. I was devastated and decided to work really hard during the summer in order to lose them <em>once and for all</em>. Once again, it was tormenting, but it worked. I actually managed to reach 51.5 kg in late October of the current school year. And then, my biggest fear was realised: I ultimately lost control. In 2 months I'd reached 57 kg and counting, while after heavily indulging in christmas treats, I eventually read the number "60" when stepping on the scale. This must have been one of the most terrifying things I had to experience. Being a victim of diet culture, I felt as if I'd betrayed my beliefs. As if I'd cheated, done something unlawful. 
I know understand the erroneous nature of this way of thinking, and I aspire to be able to eliminate it this year. I know see, after reaching my lowest point, that I should have undestood how normal I was before embarking on an eternal mission to be as thin as I could possibly be.

<br></br>
I advise everyone who's been struggling with a similar issue to consult a dietitian and a therapist. A competent psychologist can aid you in your journey of self acceptance, helping you examine the mental aspect of problematic eating behaviors, while a dietician will show you how to maitain a healthier relationship with food. 

Please be kind to yourself. If you could find a picture of you at 5, 6 years old or so, that would be great. You could post it on your bathroom mirror so you can see it every day. This way, even during your darkest days, remember 
who you're really talking to when saying harsh things to yourself about your appearance. üíñ
